## Simple Calculator Application in .NET Windows Forms
This project is a simple calculator application developed using .NET Windows Forms. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with functionality for clearing the display and performing calculations. It serves as an introductory example of building a graphical user interface (GUI) application using .NET Framework.

## Features
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Clear Functionality: Users can clear the display to reset the calculator for new calculations.
- Error Handling: The application handles division by zero and other invalid operations gracefully, displaying appropriate error messages to the user.
- Keyboard Input: Users can input numbers and perform operations using both mouse clicks and keyboard input for enhanced usability.
- Memory Functions: Additional memory functions such as memory clear, memory recall, and memory store are implemented for storing intermediate results.

## Technologies Used
- .NET Framework: The application is built using .NET Framework for desktop development.
- C# Programming Language: C# is used for implementing the application logic and event handling.
- Windows Forms: The graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using Windows Forms, providing a familiar and intuitive interface for users.
- Visual Studio: Visual Studio is used as the integrated development environment (IDE) for designing, coding, and debugging the application.
- Mathematical Logic: Basic mathematical logic and algorithms are implemented to perform arithmetic operations accurately.

## Conclusion
The Simple Calculator Application in .NET Windows Forms provides a straightforward tool for performing basic arithmetic calculations in a user-friendly manner. By leveraging .NET Framework and Windows Forms, the application offers a responsive and intuitive interface for users to perform calculations quickly and efficiently.
